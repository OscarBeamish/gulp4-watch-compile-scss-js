# Front-end Gulp template using Sass and Gulp 4

Gulp template for simple front-end websites that use HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript. 
I'm using Gulp 4 to compile, prefix, and minify my files.

## Quickstart guide

* Clone or download this Git repo onto your computer.
* Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) if you don't have it yet.
* Run `npm install`
* Run `gulp` to run the default Gulp task

In this proejct, Gulp is configured to run the following functions:

* Compile the SCSS files to CSS
* Autoprefix and minify the CSS file
* Concatenate the JS files
* Uglify the JS files
* Move final CSS and JS files to a folder
